		<h1>Hello There!</h1>
		<p>My name is Jacqueline Castro and I'm a 21 year old AGPM student at UCSC who
			will be graduating by the end of this Spring Quarter! A little bit about
			myself I suppose: I'm a triplet who's originally came from San Diego.
			When people hear this little fact about me, most people assume that my
			other triplets are all girls but no, they're boys and we're all incredibly
			different.
		</p>
		<p>I personally love to make art and the main reason I do is because I have
			so many stories that I'd like to tell one day and being able to visually
			show these stories through art is such a fascinating concept to me.
			It's why I want to make video games. Besides art, I love to play videogames
			and I'm currently learning how to rollerskate. I'm not very good at it at
			the moment, but I'm slowly getting there. And that is what matters!
