      <h2>WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h2>
        <p  class="textColor" >For this assignment, we really wanted to focus on using buttons to change things and how to
          add outside libraries to our code with jQuery. In addition, the professor wanted us to get familiar
          with the tool since it has a lot of different abilities that we could use for future projects.</p>

      <h2>ANY DIFFICULTIES</h2>
        <p class="textColor">The program was a little time consuming and some time was dedicated to researching how to do things
        but overall the assignment wasn't too bad to do. I was a little confused with the instructions as well
        as where to label things or, if we're adding everything in through our javascript. Other than that in
        was pretty straightforwards and the longest thing to do was just figuring out what colors I wanted
        and what I wnated to change.</p>

      <h2>RESULTS</h2>
        <p  class="textColor" >You can see the results right when you click these buttons! Each button changes their box to a corresponding
        color you can see when you hover over the button, when clicked, the whole box changes colors! In addition, right
        below is a bunch of different buttons which changes all the buttons and boxes of output to a certain color!</p>
