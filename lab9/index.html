      <h1>Lab 9: JavaScript For The Web</h1>
        <p>For this assignment, we had to focus on changing and adding things to our webpage
        using Javascript instead of CSS.</p>
      <h2>ANY DIFFICULTIES</h2>
        <p>Overall, I think the assignment went pretty well. The assignment was pretty easy to
        me personally and we completed it the day it was assigned. It always helps that we kind
        of go over the exact things for our lab in class. </p>
        <p>Personally, the only Challenge that I faced was when I tried to change the CSS for
          the Header tag and all the other tags. It took me the longest time to realize that
          the information is stored in an array so you have to call an array value. Maybe I can
          go back and figure out how to include everything, but for now, I'm okay with it.
        </p>
      <h2>RESULTS</h2>
        <p>You can see the results for our appends to the Output div right below.
          I changed every single color of the page and all the text. That was mainly only the thing
          I did. It's just because I'm really indecisive when I pick colors so it took a little
          too long for me to pick ones that I liked. </p>
