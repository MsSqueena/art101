  <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions & Callbacks</h1>
    <p>The goal for this assignment was to try using anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
  <h2>ANY DIFFICLTIES</h2>
    <p>The assignment itself wasn't too difficult. In general, it was pretty straightforwards.
      As for the bonus task, the one where you print your console log to the document, that was horrid.
      I couldn't figure it out for the life of me. I understood the code that our professor had
      written down for us to use, but it's the function to make it work that's the issue. I couldn't get it to work
      at all. </p>
  <h2>RESULTS</h2>
    <p>You can see the output in the Developer's tools!</p>
