  <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions & Callbacks</h1>
    <p>The goal for this assignment was to try using anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
  <h2>ANY DIFFICLTIES</h2>
    <p>The assignment itself wasn't too difficult. In general, it was pretty straightforwards.
      As for the bonus task, the one where you print your console log to the document, that was horrid.
      I couldn't figure it out for the life of me. I understood the code that our professor had
      written down for us to use, but it's the function to make it work that's the issue. I couldn't get it to work
      at all. </p>
  <h2>RESULTS</h2>
    <p>You can see the output in the Developer's tools!</p>

  <h1>Output</h1>
    <p>UPDATE: It took us a hot second to figure out what to do. Apparently instead of making a function for the
      rest of the code, we where just suppose to submit the strings. Since I wanted to print the whole console.log,
      I decided to just store each line of code into an array called "mapResults" like the ones that professor has
      in his example. After doing that and adding the "defer" value to when we call our script, it now works!
