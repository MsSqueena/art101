    <h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>
      <p>This lab was very similar to the previous lab where we just kept on working with API's and trying to get them to work.</p>
    <h2>ANY DIFFICULTIES</h2>
      <p>Many, MANY difficulties in this one and it's not becuase the concept itself was hard. We understood what we had to do.
        My partner and I breezed throught the previous lab after understanding what we needed to do however that all changed
        when we appraoched this lab. The problem was, we had the CORE error again but this time we had the CORE installed. It was
        the same error that bothered us in our last lab so we coudldn't understand why it wasn't working when we had it installed.
        For several days and hours my partner and I tried to figure it out but we just gave up, deciding to wait for the next
        lecture to figure out what is wrong.</p>
      <p>The answer?</p>
      <p>The CORE unblocker was not in fact on, we needed to pin it to our tool board and all of a sudden all of our code just worked.</p>
      <p>That was it, that was literally it and it was so frustrating to do becasue if we knew we could have literally done it in like 2 hours.
        Have the code, the document, and everything done in a very short amount of time. But oh well I suppose. At least we know now. </p>
    <h2>RESULTS</h2>
      <p>You can see it right below! It outputs the API of the current comic, the old comic example, and it runs through all the other comics
        easily in order if you press the <b>previous</b> button or the <b>next</b> button.
