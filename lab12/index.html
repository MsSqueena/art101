    <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
      <p>For this lab we had to work with if else statments!</p>
    <h2>ANY DIFFICULTIES</h2>
      <p>This weekened I had a family emergency and I wasn't really there to work with my partner but on Monday we met in the morning.
         I managed to get most of it done really quickly actually and when I met up with my partner before I had to go to work, we managed to
         debug eachother's work a little bit. Overall, there wasn't that many challenges.</p>
    <h2>RESULTS</h2>
      <p>You can see it on the box below! It outputs which house you are from and a desciription for that house that was taken by the wizarding world website
        where they had a bunch of descriptions for each house. I essentially copy and pasted it so I don't claim any of it as original at all. </p>
