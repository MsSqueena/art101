	<h1>Hello World </h1>

	<p>Hello! My name is <span style="font-weight:bold">Jacqueline Castro</span> and I am a fourth year AGPM student!
		My partner is <span style="font-weight:bold">Yasmin Kashani</span> and they are a third year Computer Science Major!
		My partner is pretty cool and I'm happy that I got to work with them.
		 A couple fun facts about Yasmin is that she enjoys going on picnics and that she has never broken a bone.
