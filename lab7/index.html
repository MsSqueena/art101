    <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
      <p>For this lab we are going to play around with strings and functions to
        print out user inputed text.</p>
    <h2>ANY DIFFICULTIES</h2>
      <p>I think this assignment was pretty straightfoward to me and that in part was because we kind of did it in class.
        We did have a little bit of a problem here and there. The first one was that my partner's script wouldn't print and
        we figured it was because they had <b>console.log</b> instead of <b>document.writeln</b>. After that it was just little
        errors that appeared randomly here and there.</p>
    <h2>RESULTS</h2>
      <p>My resutls are right on the bottom. I know that it says to add specific lines for it, but I thought it would
        flow better with words so I decided to do that and bold out the user input to make it a little clearer.</p>

      <h1>Script Output</h1>
      <script src="js/lab7.js"></script>
    </div>
    <p>Did you notice how the <b>Capital</b> letters were not effected by the sorting? How about tyring to write your whole name in capital letters, it's sorting now right?
      That's because capital letters and lowercase letters are considered slightly different and as always, capital letters come first which is why the order may be just
      a tad bit wrong.</p>
    <p>As a <b>bonus</b>, I suppose I did two things (well, really just one). I <b>put my window.prompt outside of the function</b> and then the other thing I kind of did was<b>
      have a div for the script output</b> I say kind of because all of my script since we started putting those script outputs in has it's own div named "script" which just edits
      the code to look just like the 'p' value and slightly smaller since they tend to be bigger than the regular scale. So while our 'p' is 150%, however the script tends to be
      bigger in size than the default 'p' so that is just 100% to match. I'm not sure if this actually works for the <b>bonus</b> but I think it's just nice to add.</p>
