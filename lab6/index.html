		<h1>Lab 6: Arrays & Objects</h1>
			<p>I believe this assignment was to mainly get us comfortable with using javascript a bit
				more than before. In addition it introduced us to Arrays and Objects.</p>
		<h2>ANY DIFFICULTIES?</h2>
			<p>This lab was realitively easy for my partner and I so there wasn't that many challenges.
				However, if i needed to list one, it would be displaying the javascript text onto our page.</p>
			<p>I initially did not have a problem with this sense I just copy and pasted the script that we used
				for the last lab, however my partner used the script from this lab and it woudln't appear. I'm not sure
				why it did that but it was an interesting thing to note overall.</p>
		<h2>RESULTS?</h2>
			<p>We managed to use the arrays and the objects and use document.writeln to display it on a index.html page
				as you can see in the box below! As always, though I'm unsure if we ever really need it, the screenshot for
				all of these things are right at the bottom.</p>
