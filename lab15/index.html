    <h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
      <p>For this lab, we get to play around with AJAX but most importantly, we
        get to play around with the different uses of API and how to implement
        and reach out to different ones. </p>
    <h2>ANY DIFFICULTIES</h2>
      <p>I did NOT attend the lecture that day because of a lot of personal life
        things getting in the way. Sadly, becuase I wasn't there I didn't
        understand how to use API or AJAX in general. it was incredible confusing.
        however after attending class today, it made a lot more sense than it
        did before and I kind of got the hang of it after several hours.</p>
    <h2>RESULTS</h2>
      <p>You can see the results right on the bottom. The first box is where I'm
        calling the Pokemon.api to call out pokemon information. I did it perhaps
        the most...unprofessional and least recommended way, but it worked.
        just type in the pokemon name in all lower cases and it works!
      </p>
      <p>As for the one below. NASA! and it works.</p>

      <p>All lowercase letters please or it won't work.</p>
      <input type="text" id="pokemon"/>
      <button id="activate">Click Me to Activate</button>

  <div id="homepage">
    <h1>NASA's Picture of the Day</h1>
      <p>BONUS TASK X: Let's try out the api with a key code</p>
