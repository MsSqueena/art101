    <h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
      <p>For this assignment, we had to learn how to work with Forms and how to add events like buttons.
        The main assignment was to do our lab 7 into a new format initilized by a button.
      </p>
    <h2>ANY DIFFICULTIES</h2>
      <p>This assignment felt a little trickier. Maybe it was because we didn't have as much time as my partner
        and I would normally have due to our busy schedules conflicting that week, however it was a lot of debugging
        if anything. I took a lot of time researching how to do the <b>Form</b> that was mentioned in the assignment.
        But after several hours of rewritting and researching what to do, it made a little more sense. <b>W3 School</b>
        is incredible at showing how things are done but it takes a little while to find and shuffle through all the links.
      </p>
      <p>After that, the hardest part to do after transfering it was doing the annegram. At first I was a little concerned
        becuase I understood annegrams to be words that could be other words like <b>icecream</b> and <b>cinema</b> however,
        after looking at our Professor's page, I realized it was more like shuffling words around to make a new word entirely.
        It didn't have to make sense, but it was something new with proper capitalization.
