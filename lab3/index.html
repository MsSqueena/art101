	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>

	<p>Overall, I think the main thing we did for this lab is how to embed images to a page and how to jump around from one page to another using links. You
		can mostly see the things we did in this page specifically. A whole paragraph on top separated by headers and then a bunch of screenshots on the bottom
		of the page. </p>
	<p>The advantage of this is that literally the lab before us, I was wondering how on earth do we see our web page and by being able to link to different
		indexes, we are able to seamlessly go to one page to the next without having to punch it into the URL. </p>

	<h2>ANY DIFFICULTIES?</h2>

	<p>On my end, I don’t think I encountered a lot of problems. Having some familiarity with CSS and HTML from a class I took in the fall, this felt pretty straight forward.
		 Especially using GitHub. As someone who works in game design and who makes games with a collaborative team, GitHub is your friend. I don’t use it that much but
		 it’s familiar.</p>
	<p>As for my partner however, we did run into a couple issues with adding photos. I’m not sure how we are ideally meant to add pictures into the directory however
		 I usually just open my file explorer and drag it into the img folder and then boom, it’s in there. My partner had a little bit of hard time linking especially when
		 it came to the src link. However I managed to help them.</p>
	<p>For one instance they where trying to grab their images from the lab 3 folder, however we realized after a bit that it was just located in the outer most
		  img file. We switched it over but I’m also aware that we could just write two dots in the front and to link it again, but it’s probably a good idea
			to keep the links clean. </p>
	<p>There was one more instance where we where working on the outer most index to add our links. They had the href only leading the lab# and it was interesting
		to see because I’ve seen pages like that before plenty of times however I’m never actually known how it’s done. Download a weird looking mod for a game and it
		looks like a file type of thing, I suppose it just means they linked to a file instead of an actual index page. </p>
  <p>Otherwise, it went pretty well. Just a mix up here and there.</p>

	<h2>RESULTS?</h2>
		<p>Well the results are kind of everything that you see on the homepage and on this page. Why? Because for one, it means the linking is working. Secondly
			it means that I was able to match the CSS from the homepage onto this page. Now am I doing it the most efficient way. . . probably not but it works. </p>
		<p>We have the active links working and the images moving around on screen.</p>

		<h1>Lab 3: Screenshots</h1>

		<p> Here are my screenshots down below!</p>
		<p>I had originally intend to add all my screenshots inside the box, along with the captions as added in the description, however, I couldn’t figure out how
			to do it. Maybe if I kept on fiddling and playing around with it, I could have figured it out however I think I’m kind of okay with what I have. </p>
		<p>Instead, I shall narrate to you right here what I have!</p>
		<p>I guess another thing to note is that I tried to add the screenshots to this box by moving around, using floats and such, but I can't get the screenshots
			quite working here so it's just going to be below the page. </p>
		<p>On the left sides we have the Index for the home page and for lab 3 (although the one for lab 3 is a little outdated just because I took the screenshot
			before adding the image for screenshot. . . of lab 3 so? But otherwise pretty similar with a little bit of added text on the bottom.</p>
		<p>On the right side we have the CSS before and after being added on the home page.</p>
