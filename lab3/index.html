	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
	<p>Overall, this lab seems to focus on link differenet parts of
		our webpage together and how to add images to our page.
		hence the screenshots we added on this page and the homepage.
		The advantage of this is that before we weren't able to actually
		go to our page without putting it into the url but now, we don't
		have to worry about that. </p>
	<h2>ANY DIFFICULTIES?</h2>
	<p>On my end, personal, I don't think I did. I'm personally somewhat
		used to adding images to a file because of using github for browser
		games. There was a slight issue with how to add the image to the folder
		however I just opened it in file explore (because I'm on a windows laptop)
		and just dragged it directly in, changing the name and linking it.
		Otherwise, pretty good.</p>
	<h2>RESULTS?</h2>
		<p>As you can see, we now have a homepage that links to things and now we
			pictures everywhere and we have screenshots to show just below. </p>
