	<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding & Problem-Solving</h1>
		<p>For this lab, our main focus was to really think about Pseudocode. Or in other words, makeing code sound like a step by step procedure in a way.
			Coding talk can be pretty wordy but by being able to walk yourself through it in a less technical way helps a lot when it comes to understanding the code
			you're making.</p>
		<p>Below, I have a couple of the examples of the Pseudocoding that we did. Task One & Two are seperated by seperate boxes so their just existing down there
			for you to see if you like.</p>

	<h2>ANY DIFFICULTIES?</h2>
		<p>I think the hardest thing about this project was what to make Pseudocode of. I've noticed that abstract concepts tend to be the hardest for me to do.
			For example, before we settled on the Flappy Bird Clone, my partner suggested Procreate.</p>
		<p>It wasn't a bad idea to approach, however, because it felt a little abstract since it had a lot of tools and pieces instead of a linear series of events
			(or at least it felt like that in my brain), it was harder for me to make the list or connection in my brain. Flapybird (although I've never played it
			before) felt like it made a lot more sense to me because there's a little bit of a series of events to it.
			So finding what the pseudocode was the difficult part for me personally.</p>
		<p>For my partner, it seemed like the thing they where having trouble with was pictures. From what I've heard	from other people, the image part and formatting
			it certainly sounds like the hardest part. But we'll figure it out.</p>

	<h2>RESULTS?</h2>
		<p>Pseudocode! Well, two pseudocode examples actually, and you can see those exaples and screenshots for this lab right below. The first one was a Pseudocode
			for making Lemonbars and I felt like that was pretty straightfowards in general. Now, the computer program was the hard one. On that note, I now know how
			to add code to be printed in a certain way. I did not know that before.</p>
		<p>But yeah, everything is down below :)</p>

		<h1>Task One: Everyday Pseudocode</h1>
		<p>For this part of the assignment, we where told to make a Pseudocode for an "everday" task.
			The task that my partner and I decided on was how to make lemon bars!</p>

		<h2>How To Make Lemon Bars</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 350 Degrees</li>
				<li>Grease a 9x13 pan</li>
				<li>Make the crust</li>

				<ul>
					<li>In a bowl add 2c flour, 1/2c sugar, 1/4tsp salt</li>
					<li>Add 1c butter</li>
					<li>Mix until it's a fine crumb</li>
				</ul>

				<li>Press the mixture into a pan, flattened</li>
				<li>Bake until golden brown around the edges, 20 mins</li>
				<li>Make the filling:</li>

					<ul>
						<li>In a bowl add 1 1/2c Sugar, 1/4c flour</li>
						<li>Add 4 large eggs</li>
						<li>Whisk everything together</li>
						<li>Zest 2 large lemons</li>
						<li>Halve the lemons and add the zest and juice to the mixture</li>
						<li>Combine everything together</li>
					</ul>

					<li>Pour filling over the crust, bake for 20 mins</li>
					<li>Cool in the fridge for a minimun of 2 hours</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Shift powdered suger on top if you like</li>
					</ul>

					<li>Cut into Squares and Enjoy!</li>
			</ol>

			<h1>Task Two: Computer Pseudocode</h1>
			<img id="labFourSS-Two" src="img/FlappyBirdImage.jpg" />
				<p>For the second task, we had to make a computer based pseudocode. As writen in the example, "Pic a task you might want to do on a computer, a game,
					a webpage process, automation, whatever".</p>
				<p>I don't really work on whatever BUT we decided to brainstorm several options and we just kind of ended up doing a Flappy Birds Clone. Why?
					Because it feels simple enough to explain I suppose. lol. </p>

				<h2>Pseudocode for a Flappy Bird Clone</h2>
	<pre><code>
	/* Creating a Flappy Bird Clone:
			1.Print the background
			2.Randomize Obstacles (has a set range)
			3.Add player
			4.Accept user Input (taps)
			5.Evaluate movement
			6.Start Score
			7.Check for Player's hitbox
			8.If Hitbox touches obstacle, end, otherwise, loop check for hitbox.
	*/
	</pre></code>
