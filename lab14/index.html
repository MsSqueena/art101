    <h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
      <p>For this lab, it was kind of an easy way to go back to passed labs and improve them.
      </p>
    <h2>ANY DIFFICULTIES</h2>
      <p>Even though this was a really nice opportunity to let people improve their past
        work, my partner and I actually work pretty well together and didn't think that we needed
        to improve our past projects. I think we were getting some pretty solid grades on them
        and most of the time, my partner and I did the bonus tasks as well.
      </p>
      <p>On another end, my partner and I are also struggling with out groups. We aren't getting
        as much cooperation as we woudl like as I've been the only one to really turn in any work
        for the website itself and I've been programming it....so for this week I decided to focus
        rather on improving and programming said website. I hope that that is okay.
      </p>
    <h2>RESULTS</h2>
      <p>
        I believe for this lab, our only result is the text we present above. My partner and I
        not present any new information to share and we did not change any of our past work.
      </p>
      <p>We have a section right below that is called 'Debugging' and that is because in
        task One it is asking up sto create a section for it. As for Task 2, we didn't really change
        anythign I I'm assuming we woudl add screenshots to thing's we've changed into the 'Debugging'
        list however it is as it is.
      </p>
      <p>On a random note though, a lot of the debugging techniques that where shown in class where
        things that I have already done. I use the console religiously and constantly look at it to
        find ways in order to improve my code and I often encourage my partner to do the same.
