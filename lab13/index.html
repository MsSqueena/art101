      <h1> Lab 13: Loops</h1>
        <p>For this assignment we mainly looked at using For Loops. </p>
      <h2>ANY DIFFICULTIES</h2>
        <p>This lab was pretty straightforwards to me. Yes, I had a couple of bugs
        here, but it was more just debugging and syntax errors. The thing that took
        the most time was actually writing all the moduals down. Perhaps there was a more
        efficient way of doing it, however I decided to just use AND for everything.
        The next thing to consider after that is the order that I placed the if else
        statements. If I did it in the wrong order, they would print out incorrectly
        and just kind of override eachother since it works that once the first condition
        is met, the rest are ignorned.</p>
      <h2>RESULTS</h2>
        <p>You can see the results down below! Just like how the professor had his page,
        I decided to do Bonus Tasks: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Can you add an additional factor? Example, 7 = Bang!</li>
          <li>Can you avoid hardcoded values in your code, and define a few constants
            at the top of your code that makes it easier to change values to text?</li>
          <li>Can you create a form that allows to change the max number we loop through?</li>
          <li>Can you add form fields that allow you to change the facotrs we are looking for and the
            text that gets reported?</li>
          <li>Can you style the output so it prints neatly in columns</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Out of the lists of bonus tasks, I believe that I've managed to do all of them.</p>
